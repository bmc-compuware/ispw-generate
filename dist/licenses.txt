LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR BMC CONNECTOR

BY OPENING THE PACKAGE, INSTALLING, CLICKING “AGREE” OR “YES”, DOWNLOADING, OR USING THE BMC CONNECTOR AND/OR THE MATERIALS WITHIN THE BMC CONNECTOR, THE ENTITY OR INDIVIDUAL ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND THE TERMS OF ANY THIRD-PARTY FILES OR PROGRAMS EMBEDDED IN BMC CONNECTOR (SUCH THIRD-PARTY TERMS ARE FOUND IN THE APPLICABLE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS, RELEASE NOTES, TEXT FILE, OR DISTRIBUTION FILE). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE BMC CONNECTOR. IF YOU REJECT THIS AGREEMENT, YOU WILL NOT ACQUIRE ANY LICENSE TO USE THE BMC CONNECTOR.

This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is an agreement between the entity or individual entering into this Agreement (“Licensee”) and BMC Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“BMC”), located at 2103 CityWest Blvd., Houston, Texas 77042. In addition to the restrictions imposed under this Agreement, any other usage restrictions contained in the BMC Connector’s installation instructions and release notes shall apply to Licensee’s use of the BMC Connector and all materials contained therein. 

1. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement governs Licensee’s use of BMC code that connects certain BMC products to third party products, including but not limited to Microsoft Visual Studio (such BMC code in each instance, a “BMC Connector”). Licensee may not access or use the BMC Connector if it is a direct competitor of BMC, unless otherwise authorized by BMC to do so in writing.

2. LICENSE. Subject to this Agreement, BMC grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable (per Section 3 of this Agreement), and royalty-free right under trade secrets rights and copyrights to install, access and use the BMC Connector (i) for Licensee’s internal business operations and (ii) in accordance with any documentation provided with the BMC Connector (the “Documentation”).

3. RESTRICTIONS. Licensee will not: (a) modify, delete or remove any ownership, title, trademark, patent or copyright notices from the BMC Connector, or copy or make a partial copy of the BMC Connector; (b) disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to derive any BMC Connector source code from object code, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law despite this limitation without possibility of contractual waiver; (c) provide a third party with the results of any functional evaluation, or performance tests, without BMC's prior written approval; or (d) attempt to disable or circumvent any of the licensing mechanisms within the BMC Connector.

4. TERMINATION. This Agreement terminates automatically if Licensee breaches any of its terms. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause. Upon termination, Licensee must cease use of the BMC Connector and the BMC Connector must be promptly destroyed and removed from any computer system.

5. OWNERSHIP. BMC, or its affiliates or licensors, retains all right, title, and interest in the BMC Connector and copies thereof, and any intellectual property, informational, industrial property, and proprietary rights therein. The BMC Connector is protected by applicable copyright and trade secret rights and may be protected by patent and other intellectual and industrial property laws. BMC neither grants to Licensee any license to any BMC patents nor transfers any rights of ownership in the BMC Connector to Licensee. BMC reserves any rights not expressly granted to Licensee in this Agreement.

6. CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. The BMC Connector contains valuable confidential information and trade secrets of BMC. Licensee agrees to use all reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized use, copying, publication, or dissemination of the BMC Connector. Licensee may not disclose the BMC Connector or any part thereof to any third party; provided, however, Licensee may disclose the BMC Connector, or parts thereof, to Licensee’s employees provided that such employee (i) is one that needs to receive the disclosure of the BMC Connector in order to install, use, support or maintain the BMC Connector and (ii) has obligations of confidentiality with regard to the BMC Connector, which are at least as protective of BMC’s confidential information and trade secrets as the provisions of this Agreement.

7. INDEMNIFICATION. If a third party asserts a Claim (as defined herein) against BMC, Licensee will at its own expense defend or settle the Claim and indemnify and hold harmless BMC, its affiliates, and licensors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any loss, claim, liability, damage, action or cause of action (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to any third party claim concerning Licensee’s use of the BMC Connector in violation of this Agreement (a “Claim”). Licensee will not bind BMC to a monetary obligation in a settlement or compromise, or make an admission
on behalf of BMC, without obtaining BMC’s prior consent.

8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. THE BMC CONNECTOR IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITH ALL FAULTS. BMC, ITS AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT. BMC DOES NOT WARRANT 
THAT THE OPERATION OF THE BMC CONNECTOR WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR VIRUS OR ERROR FREE, THAT THERE ARE NO DEFECTS, OR THAT ANY DEFECT IN SUCH CAN BE CORRECTED. 

9. LIMITS ON BMC’S LIABILITY. NEITHER BMC, ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS, WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE USE OF THE BMC CONNECTOR, OR ANY THIRD PARTY CODE OR SOFTWARE PROVIDED WITH THE BMC CONNECTOR (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST COMPUTER USAGE TIME, AND DAMAGE TO, OR LOSS OF USE OF DATA), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY NEGLIGENCE OF BMC OR WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM A CLAIM ARISING UNDER TORT OR CONTRACT LAW. BMC’S LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE BMC CONNECTOR, IF ANY, AND (II) $500. 

10. VERIFICATION. If requested by BMC, Licensee will deliver to BMC written certification relating to Licensee’s use of the BMC Connector in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. BMC may audit Licensee’s use of the BMC Connector to confirm such compliance. 

11. EXPORT CONTROLS. Both parties agree to comply with applicable export regulations, including but not limited to U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the OFAC embargoes and sanctions lists. More information on BMC’s export compliance program may be found here: https://www.bmc.com/legal/export-compliance.html. 

12. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or to the formation, interpretation, breach, termination, or validity thereof (each, a “Controversy”) will be resolved as follows:  
(i) UNITED STATES. If both parties to this Agreement are entities incorporated under the law of any state in the United States, the Controversy shall be tried in either state or federal court located in Houston, Texas and the laws of the State of Texas shall govern. Both parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Houston, Texas and waive all defenses based on forum non conveniens. 
(ii) EMEA. If both parties to this Agreement are entities incorporated in countries in the Europe, Middle East, or Africa regions, the Controversy shall be tried in the District Court located in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and the substantive laws of the Netherlands shall govern. Both parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and waive all defenses based on forum non conveniens. 
(iii) ASIA PACIFIC. If both parties to this Agreement are entities incorporated in countries in the Asia Pacific region, the arbitration shall be held in Singapore under the then-applicable rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre and the substantive laws of Singapore will govern. 
(iv) OTHER REGIONS. In all other instances, the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York, under the then-applicable international rules of the American Arbitration Association and the substantive laws of the State of Texas will govern. 
For all arbitrations conducted hereunder: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted in English; (b) the relevant arbitral institution shall determine the number of arbitrators, but any Controversy in which the amount in dispute is greater than $10 million USD shall be decided by three arbitrators, with each party having the right to select one arbitrator; (c) the costs of such arbitration shall be borne equally, pending the arbitrator’s award; (d) the arbitration award rendered shall be final and binding on the parties, shall not be subject to appeal to any court and shall be enforceable in any court having jurisdiction over the parties; (e) the arbitration 
proceedings, award and pleadings shall all be confidential, unless disclosure of particular information is required for purposes of enforcing/challenging the award or to meet local securities law requirements; and (f) the party prevailing in arbitration shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and the necessary costs incurred in connection with the arbitration. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking immediate injunctive relief from any court having jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of the dispute. 

13. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USER RIGHTS. This Section applies only to acquisitions of the commercial product and documentation subject to this Agreement by or on behalf of the United States Government, or by any prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) under any contract, grant, agreement or other activity with the United States Government. When products are delivered or provided to the United States Government, the United States Government agrees that this commercial license Agreement and the products governed by this Agreement are defined in accordance with and qualify as “commercial items” consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as outlined in FAR 12.211, FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.202-3, as applicable. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall pertain to the United States Government’s use (including documentation or technical data), duplication, and disclosure of the BMC Connector, and shall supersede any conflicting contractual terms and conditions. 

14. DATA PROTECTION. (a) Licensee acknowledges that BMC neither requires nor needs Licensee to (i) send BMC any personal data collected by Licensee (“Licensee Collected Data”) or (ii) give BMC access to any Licensee Collected Data. Consequently, Licensee remains responsible for either filtering, making anonymous, encrypting such Licensee Collected Data or for having proper procedures in place to prevent Licensee Collected Data from being sent to or accessed by BMC. (b) In the course of normal business, BMC may collect and process personal information related to the Licensee (mainly contact and related information) in order to perform its obligations under this Agreement, such information being referred to hereinafter as “Licensee Contact Information”. Where the Licensee Contact Information is to be processed by BMC, BMC will comply with its Controller and Processor Binding Corporate Rules Policy found at http://media.cms.bmc.com/documents/External+Privacy+Binding+Coporate+Rules+Policy+-+Aug+04.pdf (the “BCR”) with respect to compliance with data protection laws and/or regulations. The BCR policy is incorporated into a BMC corporate wide policy, requiring all BMC entities, employees and third party providers to comply with and respect the BCR policy, which is governing the collection, use, access, storage and transfer of personal data among BMC entities and third-party sub-processors. The details of the BCR approval of BMC Software are available at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/binding-corporate-rules/bcr_cooperation/index_en.htm. BMC shall in particular: (i) allow Licensee to access, modify, correct or erase Licensee Contact Information when necessary; (ii) take reasonable technical and organizational security measures to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of Licensee Contact Information and to prevent its unauthorized access, use, or disclosure; and (iii) refrain from using Licensee Contact Information for any other purpose than performing its obligations under this Agreement.

15. MISCELLANEOUS TERMS. This is the entire agreement of the parties, and it supersedes and replaces all prior and contemporaneous agreements and negotiations with respect to this subject matter. There are no representations, promises, warranties, covenants, or undertakings between the parties other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement may only be amended by a signed writing of the parties. Licensee may not assign or transfer this Agreement without BMC’s prior written consent. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise, or the exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement. If any part of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be modified to the extent necessary to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, and the remaining terms will be in full force and effect. The BMC Connector may contain third party software which is delivered to Licensee as part of the BMC Connector and may not be taken out of the BMC Connector or used separately from the BMC Connector and for which additional terms may be included in the Documentation. The BMC Connector may contain hyperlinks to websites controlled by parties other than BMC. BMC is not responsible for and does not endorse the content or accept any responsibility for Licensee’s use of these websites. During the term of this Agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws and for internal purposes only, BMC may compile and use information related to Licensee’s use of the BMC Connector, for the purposes of: (a) enhancing and improving BMC’s products or technology, developing new products and technology, and for other development, diagnostic, statistical and corrective purposes; and (b) better informing the Licensee of relevant products. Licensee should refer to the policies posted by other websites regarding data privacy and other topics before using them. The parties have agreed that this Agreement and the documents related thereto be drawn up in the English language. Les parties exigent que la présente convention ainsi que les documents qui s’y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais.

YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND INTEND TO BE BOUND, AS IF YOU HAD SIGNED THIS AGREEMENT IN WRITING. IF YOU ARE ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, YOU WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR SUCH ENTITY.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
      distributed with this file, You can
      obtain one at
      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by
      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
